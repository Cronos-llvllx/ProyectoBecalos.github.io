# Project Web: My first portfolio and Clon Starbucks with CSS and HTML.

Hi, my name is Dan! and this is my Becalos project. A project where I was in a 2-month Frontend development bootcamp, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS where I learned a lot, I was able to create my own website and there I nested a simple clone that I made of Starbucks. I missed some details but since I made 2 pages, I feel like I learned a lot.

## How to test my code

1. **Requirements:**
* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
* (Optional, but recommended) A code editor to view the source code (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

2. **Steps:**
* **Clone the Repository (if you don't have the files):** If you got this code from a repository (e.g. GitHub), clone it to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone [Repository URL]
```
* Replace `[Repository URL]` with the URL of your project's repository.
* **Navigate to the project directory:** Once cloned (or if you already have the folder), navigate to the root directory of your project from the terminal, use the command `cd <folder name>`.
```bash
cd [your project folder name]
```
* Replace `[your project folder name]` with the actual name of your project folder.
* **Opening the `index.html` file:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser.
* You can do this in several ways:
* **From the file explorer:** Find the `index.html` file in your file explorer and double-click it to open it with your default browser.
* **From the terminal:** If your operating system is Linux or MacOS, run `open index.html`, if it is Windows, run `start index.html`.

* **Exploring the page:** View the web page in your browser. Observe the layout, images, and behavior.

3. **Notes:**
* Make sure the folder and file structure is kept intact, meaning that `.html`, `.css`, and images are in the correct folders.
* The main file is `index.html`.
* Images are located in the `imagesStarbacks` folder (or whatever folder you use for images).
* Styling is located in `style.css`.
